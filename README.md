The Supermarket Billing System is designed to simplify billing processes for supermarkets. It allows users to add items to inventory, generate bills for customers, and automatically update stock levels after each transaction. All data is stored in a persistent text file for future reference.

## Features
- **Add Items**: Add items with their name, rate, and quantity to the inventory.
- **Generate Bills**: Calculate and print bills based on selected items and quantities.
- **Inventory Management**: Automatically updates stock after billing.
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses a text file (`Bill.txt`) to store inventory data.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/supermarket-billing-system.git
   cd supermarket-billing-system
   ```

2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

- Ensure the `Bill.txt` file is in the same directory as the executable while running the program.
- Replace `system("cls")` and `Sleep()` functions for non-Windows systems if needed.
